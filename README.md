Orbit is a powerful platform designed to facilitate large-scale Nuclei scans, enabling teams to efficiently manage and analyze scan results. By integrating modern technologies with a web frontend in SvelteKit and a backend in Go, with Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure and automation, Orbit streamlines the process of running security scans and collaborating on findings.
